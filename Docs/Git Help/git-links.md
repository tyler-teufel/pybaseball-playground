# Helpful Git Sites + Tutorials

Git can be a bit of a learning curve.

As powerful as a tool as it is, it can also frustrate you just as easily as it can help - so I have compiled below a bunch of different links that will hopefully make your life easier in learning version control - the more you use it, the easier it gets, and the more organized you can be with your changes!

You also can always ask for help, don't ever hesitate to.
