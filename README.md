## Setup a virtual environment for minimal problems with Python versioning

<br>

### 1. Create the virtual environment (venv):

Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

where `myenv` is the name of the venv, and you can change that to whatever you prefer.

I named mine `pybaseball-playground`.

### 2. Activate the venv:

Run the following command in the terminal to enter the virtual environment:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

With the same naming context in mind, run this command in the terminal to enter the environment.

### 3. Install the packages needed:

Run the following command to install all of the listed package dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### If you install any new or additional packages:

Run the following command to update the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
